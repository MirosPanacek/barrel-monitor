# BUG REPORT #
## ID001 ##
### POST /barrels ###
 **Severity:** Moderate
**Desctription:**
If a user attempts to modify an existing record using the POST method and provides an barrel ID, the server returns a 500 Internal Server Error.
The POST method should be used to create a new record without specifying an existing ID. If a client includes an existing barrel ID in a POST request, the server should respond with a 400 Bad Request or 409 Conflict, rather than a 500 Internal Server Error. Modifying existing records should be done using the PUT method.

**Steps to reproduce:**
```
curl -X 'POST' \
  'https://to-barrel-monitor.azurewebsites.net/barrels' \
  -H 'accept: */*' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "id": "ff3a69a0-2ea7-4d6e-50dd-08dd4447ff51",
  "qr": "124test",
  "rfid": "458test",
  "nfc": "test"
}' -i
```

**Expected result:**
Modifying existing records should be done using the PUT method. **OR** response HTTP code: 204 No Content
**Actual result:**
Response HTTP code: 500 Internal Server Error

**Log:** 
Response headers:
 content-length: 0

 ## ID004 ##
 ### POST /measurements ###
 **Severity:** Blocker
 **Description:**
There appears to be a mismatch between the server-side schema and the API documentation, as the backend requires a Barrel field that is not documented. Valid barrel UUID used,

  "dirtLevel": 0,
  "weight": 0
}' -i
